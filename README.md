# Recognizing Asteroid Streaks using a Convolutional Neural Network

This toy project attempt to setup a Convolutional Neural Network to distinguish asteroid streaks from stars in astronomical images.

The results are presented in this [jupyter
notebook](https://github.com/mommermi/streak_detection/blob/master/Streak_Detection.ipynb).
